The student must not be older than age 20 if their student_no is either between 3 and 5 or their student_no is 7.
Your query should also return students older than age 20 but in that case they must have a student_no that is at least 4.

Query:
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE age <=20
AND (student_no BETWEEN 3 AND 5 OR student_no = 7)
OR (age > 20 AND student_no >= 4)
